      <p><strong>I</strong>t gives me immense pleasure to heartily welcome all our distinguished
        delegates to the 47th Annual Accountants Conference of the Institute of
        Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) taking place at the International
        Conference Centre Abuja, from Monday to Friday, 16 - 20 October 2017,
        under the theme “Nigeria First: Accountancy, Nation Building and the
        Future”.</p>
      <p>This landmark event prides itself as the largest congregation of Chartered
        Accountants in Africa. Last year, about 4,000 delegates; comprising
        Chartered Accountants in public practice, commerce and industry, public
        sector, the academia, as well as leaders of professional accounting
        organisations from across the West African sub-region attended the
        conference.</p>

      <p>An outstanding gallery of world-class and sought-after speakers will
        participate and share with us the most significant advances in our profession.
        Whatever sessions you choose to attend, they all seek to expand the
        profession’s horizons by empowering delegates with the latest knowledge
        and tools to become future-relevant Chartered Accountants, while upholding
        the core principles of integrity, accountability and trust which have made our
        profession invaluable and indispensable.</p>

      <p>Of course, I must thank each of our world-class speakers, all of them experts
        and leaders in their diverse fields, for graciously agreeing to share their
        wisdom and experience with us, and for this, we are eternally grateful.</p>
      <p>One unique feature of this year’s conference is its focus on the role of
        Chartered Accountants in nation building, leveraging on our public interest
        mandate. The Institute will be unveiling and launching the ICAN
        Accountability Index, which is a first of its kind mechanism for assessing
        public finance management and public governance practices of Nigerian
        public sector institutions including the Executive (the Federal, State and Local
        Governments), the Legislature and the Judiciary.</p>

      <p>The Institute is very proud of its role and that of other stakeholders in the
        development of this index, which we believe is a relevant, innovative and
        timely contribution to accountability, public finance management and
        governance practices in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Finally, I thank all our distinguished delegates for choosing to attend and
        participate at the 47th Annual Accountants’ Conference and happily look
        forward to meeting you.</p><br><br>
      <p>GOD BLESS YOU</p>
